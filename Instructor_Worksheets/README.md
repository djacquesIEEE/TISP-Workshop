# IEEE TISP Workshop Instructor/Mentor Wooksheets
All the worksheets needed by instructors or mentors to run any of the exercises are available in this subdirectory.  The worksheet document for each individual exercise is available as a separate document if you wish to download a specific file.

There are also worksheet collections for predesigned workshops catering to various levels of electronics/Arduino experience within your student group.  Each workshop collection is designed to with a given set of **Learning Objectives** which are outlined in at the beginning of the collection.  Each collection is designed to run within either a 60 minute or 90 minute duration.

Each workshop collection has a series number indicating where it falls in the progression of materials for the students.  The levels of progression go from *S1* through *S4*.

Some predefined series are suggested for you first few times as an instructor for an IEEE TISP workshop in your local secondary school, but you are welcome to create you own workshop series using any combination of the exercises once you are comfortable process.
